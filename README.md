This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Deploying to the Internet

Your application is configured to be deployed with **Firebase App Hosting**. Follow these steps to get your site live:

### 1. Install the Firebase CLI

If you don't have it installed already, open your terminal and run the following command to install the Firebase Command Line Interface (CLI) globally on your computer:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

### 2. Log in to Firebase

Next, log in to your Google account using the CLI by running:

```bash
firebase login
```

This will open a browser window for you to sign in.

### 3. Deploy Your Site

Once you are logged in, navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

The CLI will build and deploy your Next.js application. When it's finished, it will provide you with a unique URL where your live site can be accessed by anyone.

That's it! Your site is now live on the internet.
